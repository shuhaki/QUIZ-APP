# Architecture Decisions

## Component Structure

### Why Functional Components?
- Modern React best practice
- Better performance with hooks
- Cleaner code and easier testing

### State Management
- **useState**: For local component state
- **useEffect**: For side effects and data loading
- **useCallback**: For memoized functions to prevent re-renders
- **Props Drilling**: Minimal and focused data flow

### Routing Strategy
- React Router for SPA navigation
- State passing via route parameters for results
- Clean separation between quiz and results views

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Questions loaded from JSON file
2. **Filtering**: Based on selected difficulty level
3. **Shuffling**: Randomizes questions and options
4. **Progress Tracking**: Current question index and answers
5. **Scoring**: Calculated at completion
6. **Persistence**: High scores saved to localStorage

## Styling Approach

### CSS Methodology
- Component-scoped styles in App.css
- BEM-like naming convention for clarity
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- CSS custom properties for theming

### Accessibility Considerations
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance

## Performance Optimizations

- Memoized calculations with useCallback
- Efficient re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Lazy loading potential for larger question sets
- Optimized animations with CSS transforms

## Error Handling

- Try/catch blocks for data loading
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for missing features
- localStorage availability checks

## Future Enhancements

- Backend integration for question management
- User authentication and personal scores
- Question categories and tags
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics and reporting
